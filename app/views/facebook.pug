                            <p class="leading-relaxed mb-3">This is an oldie but a goodie. On your own page, post an effusive status: “OMG!!! Congratulations to my bestie [your friend’s name here] on her engagement/pregnancy/new job/wacky new tattoo!!!” Tailor it to your friend’s interests and stage of life, of course, to really make people fall for it. Don’t forget to actually tag their account rather than just type their name, so that it shows up on their profile. They’ll get swarmed with stunned, congratulatory messages and have to let all of their well-wishers down easy. And because this is one of the easy April Fools’ pranks that’s probably easiest to see through, you could try getting a few other of your and your victim’s close friends in on it. Have them post a congratulatory comment on your post, or make a post of their own, to make the “news” more believable.</p>

                            <p class="leading-relaxed mb-3">Here’s a beautifully annoying prank you can knock out during lunch hour. Go to your victim’s Facebook profile, and “like” every single thing they’ve ever posted. That’s it. The next time they log in or check the app, they will find hundreds of notifications waiting. This is especially effective if they get live updates to their phone, which will be bombarded with alerts while you’re doing your dirty work.</p>

                            <p class="leading-relaxed mb-3">With this easy April Fools’ prank, you can prank a whole bunch of your friends at once! Step 1: Copy this link: http://facebook.com/profile.php?=733 (note, you can swap out the number combination in at the end—just make sure everything up to “php?=” stays exactly the same). Step 2: Paste it into a status update. As the preview picture will reveal, this link directs you to your own Facebook profile; in fact, anyone who clicks on it will be linked to their own account. Make sure you remove the link preview box from your post so your cover isn’t blown. Step 3: Write a clever lead-in to the link—something scintillating, but also a little nasty. Example: “Police are desperately searching for this monster—please spread the word. [link]” or, “At long last, I think I’ve found the biggest jerk on Facebook: [link].” Step 4: Post it. As you wait for legions of unsuspecting friends to click through to their own profiles, go bake some cookies for all the people you’re about to annoy. Speaking of jerks on Facebook,</p>

                            <p class="leading-relaxed mb-3"> Step 1: Post this link from NPR, titled “Why Doesn’t America Read Anymore?” Include in your status a generic comment like, “So sad,” or, “Seriously, what is wrong, people?” Step 2: Wait. This “story” is actually a prank devised by NPR on April 1, 2014, to poke fun at serial commenters. “We sometimes get the sense that some people are commenting on NPR stories that they haven’t actually read,” the article says. “If you are reading this, please like this post and do not comment on it. Then let’s see what people have to say about this ‘story.’”.</p>

                            <p class="leading-relaxed mb-3">An incredibly easy but effective Facebook prank is to tag yourself in a whole bunch of your friend’s photos that you’re not in. Tag other, untagged people as you; tag their pet as you (that’ll really drive them crazy!); or, if they don’t tag themselves in their own photos, tag them as you. Or any combination thereof. They’ll be spammed with notifications that you’re tagging yourself in their photos. For some, er, subtle nudging, tag yourself in photos of get-togethers they had that you weren’t at. All in good fun, of course. </p>

                            <p class="leading-relaxed mb-3">For the next batch of easy April Fools’ pranks, you’ll need access to your friend’s profile while they’re already logged in, so that you can make some sneaky tweaks. If you work in an office, chances are you can navigate to Facebook on any coworker’s computer and find them already logged into their account. If they are, now’s your chance to really alter their profile (and probably their opinion of you as a person). The first quick prank you can pull with an unguarded profile: Change your friend’s name and profile picture to reference an inside joke.</p>

Spend a day or two tricking everyone into thinking you're going on an elaborate vacation out of nowhere. Pick a really cool destination and find other images online or on Instagram you can post, pretending they're your own. If you're good with Photoshop, put yourself there too. Act like you're away on your Story also, like posting a photo of you holding your passport. At the end of the day, make it clear that you were totally joking with a selfie of you at home.

Make it believable ‚Äî maybe use a popular fan theory ‚Äî and act like you have a link to a source. You can even say it in your Story so that people are forced to hear it.

                            <p class="leading-relaxed mb-3">These days, Instagram‚Äôs story filters are looking more and more realistic. That being said, it gives you the chance to play a trick on your followers if you post a photo with a bald filter, thin eyebrows filter, or even face tattoos. With the right angle and lighting the filter will look totally IRL.
